Creating invoices shouldn't take 30 minutes of your valuable time. Whether you're a freelancer, consultant, or small business owner, there's a faster way.

This guide shows you exactly how to create professional invoices in under 30 seconds using AI.

## The Old Way (Slow and Painful)

Most freelancers create invoices like this:

1. Open Word or Excel template (2 minutes finding the file)
2. Fill in client details manually (3 minutes)
3. Add line items one by one (5 minutes)
4. Calculate totals (2 minutes, better not make a mistake)
5. Format everything to look professional (10 minutes)
6. Save as PDF (2 minutes)
7. Second-guess if you forgot anything (5 minutes)

**Total time: 29 minutes per invoice**

If you create 3 invoices per week, that's **156 hours per year** spent on invoicing.

## The New Way (30 Seconds)

Here's the modern approach:

1. Go to ScatterPilot.com
2. Describe your invoice in plain English
3. Download professional PDF
4. Done.

**Total time: 30 seconds per invoice**

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Start a New Invoice

### Step 2: Describe Your Invoice

Just type naturally, like you're texting a friend:

> "Invoice Acme Corp for website development, 40 hours at $125/hour, due in 30 days"

The AI understands:
- **Who to invoice:** Acme Corp
- **What for:** Website development
- **How much:** 40 hours × $125/hr = $5,000
- **When it's due:** 30 days from now

### Step 3: AI Generates Your Invoice

In about 5 seconds, ScatterPilot creates a professional PDF with:

- ✅ Professional formatting
- ✅ Automatic calculations
- ✅ Clear payment terms
- ✅ Your branding (with Pro)

### Step 4: Download and Send

Click "Download PDF" and you're done. Send it to your client immediately.

## Why This Method Works

**No Forms to Fill Out**

Just describe what you need. The AI handles the rest.

**No Calculations Needed**

"40 hours at $125/hour" → AI calculates $5,000 automatically.

**Professional Every Time**

Consistent formatting. No more "does this look right?" anxiety.

**Works Anywhere**

Phone, tablet, desktop. No installation required.

## Common Questions

**Is it really free?**

Yes! Free tier includes 5 invoices per month. Perfect for occasional invoicing.

**Do I need to install anything?**

Nope. Works in your browser. No downloads, no setup.

**Can I customize it?**

## The Math That Matters

**Old way:**
- 29 minutes per invoice
- 3 invoices per week
- 156 hours per year wasted

**New way:**
- 30 seconds per invoice
- 3 invoices per week
- 1.3 hours per year

**Time saved: 154.7 hours**
